# Description:  If the player casts his fishing rod, this check verifies that he has not fished himself. However, it's possible to fish yourself at any time, even for players without a cheat client. Nevertheless, this check resets self-fishers to the position where they were last time onground. Players without cheat will not notice this, but players with cheat will notice it even more.
# Fail:         This check fails if the player has hooked himself.
