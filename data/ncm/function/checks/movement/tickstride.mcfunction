# Description:  This check evaluates fired PlayerMoveEvents based on distance and combines them into a 'movement chain' or 'stride sequence'.
# Fail:         This check fails if the value x is exceeded y times in direct temporal succession within a movement state. Moreover, this check automatically terminates if there is any clientside or serverside lag. Depending on the magnitude of the deviation from x, the check failure is either logged (Reputation/Evaluation) or the event is canceled additionally (Setback).
